## Hi there 👋

 👨🏻‍💻 My name is Beren Akpinar and I am studying Computer Science and Neuroscience at Boston University.

 💡 I am interested in pursuing research in neuroprosthetics and wearable robotics. I hope to utilize my specializaiton in R&D roles in the industry positions to help people suffering from muscular dystrophy and neurodegenerative diseases.

 👾 During my free time, I like to explore concepts in Robotics.

 🔥 Fun Facts: I love Christopher Nolan Movies, and I am a licensed windsurfer!
