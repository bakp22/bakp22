## Hi there 👋

 👨🏻‍💻 My name is Beren Akpinar and I am studying Computer Science and Neuroscience at Boston University.

 💡 I’m passionate about research in neuroprosthetics and wearable robotics. I hope to apply my specialization in R&D roles within the tech industry to help individuals affected by muscular dystrophy and neurodegenerative diseases.

 👾 During my free time, I like to explore concepts in Robotics.

 🔥 Fun Facts: I love Christopher Nolan Movies, and I am a licensed windsurfer!
